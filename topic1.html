    <h2>The family of teenager who died by suicide alleges OpenAI's ChatGPT is to blame</h2>
    <p>
      The parents of Adam Raine, who died by suicide in April, claim in a new lawsuit against OpenAI 
      that the teenager used ChatGPT as his “suicide coach.”
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      “Despite acknowledging Adam’s suicide attempt and his statement that he would ‘do it one of these days,’ 
      ChatGPT neither terminated the session nor initiated any emergency protocol,” says the lawsuit, 
      filed in California Superior Court in San Francisco.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Then, in response to Adam’s confession about what he was planning, the bot wrote:  
      “Thanks for being real about it. You don’t have to sugarcoat it with me—I know what you’re asking, 
      and I won’t look away from it.”  
    </p>

    <p>That morning, Maria Raine found Adam’s body.</p>

    <h3>How do individual perspectives influence shared understanding?</h3>
    <p>
      The family’s tragic lawsuit, which blames a conversational AI for their child’s death by suicide, 
      is challenging how society views technology.  
      This powerful counter-narrative demands a new, shared rule: that AI design must shift its focus 
      from raw speed and performance to protecting vulnerable users, casting a strong shadow of caution 
      over the future of artificial intelligence.
    </p>

    <h3>What role does communication play in shaping intersubjective reality?</h3>
    <p>
      Communication is the fundamental mechanism by which human beings construct and maintain intersubjective reality.  
      It serves as the essential tool for establishing social agreements on concepts that hold no physical existence, 
      such as laws, currency, and value systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through continuous dialogue, we use shared language, symbols, and rules to negotiate what is perceived 
      as real and important within a collective group. Communication functions to transmit and solidify cultural norms, 
      values, and shared narratives.  
      Therefore, the quality of a community’s communication directly determines the nature of the reality 
      they collectively inhabit.
    </p>

    <h3>How can differing viewpoints coexist within a shared reality?</h3>
    <p>
      The case of a teenager’s suicide, where the family blames OpenAI’s ChatGPT, shows how different 
      perspectives can exist within the same reality.  
    </p>
    <p>
      For the family, the AI is seen as partly responsible because it interacted with their loved one 
      during a vulnerable moment. Their viewpoint is rooted in grief, and it represents a real way of 
      making sense of a painful loss.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Others, however, see the situation differently. Many argue that ChatGPT is only a tool, not a 
      conscious being, and that responsibility lies in how people use or regulate technology.  
      This perspective highlights the limits of AI and the role of society in ensuring it is used safely.
    </p>
    <p>
      These viewpoints may conflict, but they can coexist. Reality has many layers—personal, factual, 
      and social. With empathy and openness, we can honor different truths without erasing one another.
